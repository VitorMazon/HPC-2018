message:
  Updated all tests for the 4.0.1 release
  
  Every test has been updated and checked.
  
  There were some tests were the energy was changed.
  This was due to fixes in the dipole correction where the
  energy contribution of an internal field is only half of
  an external field. This was a bug in prior versions.
  
  Secondly, there were a few tests missing in the Tests/Makefile
  which have now been added.

  Fixed test name for dipole_correction
  
  The dipole_correction test had an erroneous SystemLabel.
  This has been corrected.

message:
  Fixes fdf-name for maxwalltime and the variable declaration
  
  Now the walltime_warning is in real(dp) to fit the reading of
  floating point values (to prevent erroneous conversion from
  real(dp) -> integer)
  
  Fixed name reads in fdf_get to be the same as the documentation
  specification.

message:
  Provide units for max-walltime and max-walltime-slack. Add fdf_isphysical
  
  The fdf options max-walltime and max-walltime-slack should properly be
  specified with units (e.g. 2.5 hours), instead of what a single number
  interpreted as seconds.
  
  To maintain compatibility with previous usage, a new boolean function
  
   fdf_isphysical(label)
  
  has been added to the FDF library, to check whether units are given
  for the value of 'label' in the fdf file or not.

message:
  (log for r523) Update the STM programs in Util/STM
  
  (By mistake, r523 used a wrong commit log. This is the correct one)
  
  - Fix fftw plan bug in STM/ol-stm code
  
    Due to an oversight, the NX and NY dimensions were not interchanged
    in the call to the FFTW plan routine that uses the F2003 interface.
  
  - Use WFSX files as input for the STM/ol-stm program
  
    It is no longer necessary to convert the WFSX to an old-fashioned
    WFS file before using the program. This will save space and time.
  
  - Add 'stm-label' feature to STM/ol-stm program + cosmetics
    
    An optional label can be pasted in the name of the output
    files.
    Remove fossil files and update documentation.
  
  - Add test for si001-ldos. Extra lines in plstm
    
    Added a new test to compute the LDOS for the si001-H test, to
    exercise the 'simple' STM program STM/plstm
    
    In plstm, print a blank line after every set of x scans, so that
    gnuplot can work better in 'surface/contour' mode.
  
  - Add a new interpolation option 'poly' to macroave
    
    Macroave might be useful to determine automatically the right
    point at which the vacuum potential gets flat (of interest for
    STM/ol-stm operation).
    
    The 'spline' interpolation option can cause oscillations for
    functions with discontinuous derivatives. In these cases the
    'linear' option is more robust.
    
    The current implementation of the 'linear' option is quite obscure. A
    new option 'poly' has been introduced. It uses a routine derived from
    code by D.R. Hamann which implements general polynomial interpolation.
    For order=1, it can replace the 'linear' option. For now, pending an
    upgrade of the interface, 'poly' implements quadratic polynomial
    interpolation (subject to the same oscillations for non-smooth
    functions).

message:
  Add extra logging and control capabilities
  
  A number of extra control and logging features have been implemented
  to facilitate the use of Siesta within automated computational
  frameworks, notably the AiiDA platform.
  
  - A new file 'MESSAGES' holds a summary of warnings and possible errors.
  
    Calls to 'die' now print a line in MESSAGES with a 'FATAL' prefix, and
    then perform an orderly closing of the CML file, and flush stdout and
    stderr, before actually terminating the program.
  
    The routine 'message(level,str)' also prints an appropriate line in
    MESSAGES.
  
  - Optional termination if geometry is not converged
    
    If the flag 'Geometry.Must.Converge' is .true., the
    program will terminate if the geometry relaxation is
    not converged, before carrying out any final analysis.
  
  - Enhancements to the CML interface
  
    Add routine print_spin and call it at every geometry step. The final
    call in 'siesta_analysis' is preserved for backwards compatibility.
  
    Put energies in 'scf finalization' module in the CML file
  
    Write stress to CML file at each geometry step
  
    Close properly the CML stack before 'die'ing.
  
  - Add a simple interface to check wall-clock time
    
    A new module 'm_check_walltime' provides a routine
    'check_walltime' and exports variables 'walltime_max'
    and 'walltime_warning'.
    
    Users can request walltime control by means of the
    fdf variables:
    
    Max.Walltime N   # in seconds, default infinity
    Max.Walltime.Slack    # in seconds
    
    Typically, the first would be set automatically by inheritance
    from the queuing system or AiiDA script. The second should give
    an estimate of the time needed for cleanup operations. The default
    is 5 seconds.
    
    Currently, the 'check_walltime' routine is invoked at the end of
    every SCF step, and at the end of every geometry step.
  
  - Fixes for compilation
    
    Use a 'local_sys.{f,F}' file in Util programs and
    SiestaXC to decouple them from the extra functionality
    in the top-level sys.F file (particularly the CML closing
    operations).
    
    Remove the dependency of 'alloc.o' on 'debugmpi'.
    
    Add '.c' to .SUFFIXES in 'arch.make.in' 
  
  - Add arch.make suitable for fortran-mpi Docker image
  
    (Experimental)

  This fixes lp:1685169.
  The bug occurs when siesta has been compiled with:
     -ffpe-trap=invalid,zero,overflow,underflow,denormal
  which signals an SIGFPE.
  Typically these things are hidden when compiling normally and one
  should, probably, not be concerned.

  Updated Eig2DOS, now it is more consistent with the gnubands.f90 file
  
  Changed:
  -m => -e (makes more sense that small e is lower energy bound as used in gnubands)
  -M => -E (makes more sense that small e is lower energy bound as used in gnubands)
    (note that -m and -M are still workable)
  the old -e is not used anymore, however, if -d (debug) is enabled it works the same.
  -F is now equivalent to -f (as -F is used in gnubands).
  
  It now also checks whether the supplied KP file exists.

  Work around reshape in mesh3d for SiestaXC
  
  This fixes: lp:1665294
  
  Instead of doing reshape, we implement direct loops with
  an interface for copying, and one for adding.
  This should limit the heap memory consumption.
  
  I have tested this on 10 of the tests in the test directory,
  with no changes (however, only on 2 cores).
  Before releasing 4.0.1 we should rerun all tests.

  Fix bug #1656273: Inappropriate model core charges for Bader analysis
  
  Use always a gaussian-like model function to simulate the charge of
  the core electrons that is added to the pseudo charge for Bader
  analysis. The previous method, based on re-scaling chlocal, could
  sometimes introduce spurious local maxima in the total charge density
  that confuse the Bader algorithm.
  
  (Thanks to Seyed Mohammad Tabatabaei for reporting the issue)
  
  Also, add a new option 'Analyze.Charge.Density.Only', with which the
  program generates charge density files and computes partial atomic
  charges (Hirshfeld, Voronoi, Bader) from the information in the input
  density matrix, and stops.  This is useful to analyze the properties
  of the charge density without a diagonalization step (just with a
  pre-existing density-matrix), and with a user-selectable mesh cutoff.

  Differences between tbtrans and tbtrans_rep
  
  This fixes some differences reported between the
  tbtrans and tbtrans_rep codes.
  Essentially the difference was due to the integration points
  which were not distributed equivalently in the two examples.
  Now the contours are equivalent. There are still differences
  but those may be "ironed" out by increasing the number of
  integration points. So these are merely numerical artefacts.
  
  Secondly, the tbtrans_rep output printed energies in eV but
  the DOS was in 1/Ry, this is now fixed. Although it should not
  matter because it is the relative values that are important.

      This enables one to more easily figure out if the grid

      siesta now also prints the standard-deviation.
      We have found that in certain systems (a Cu-Ni slab-alloy)
      the forces were highly unsymmetric (where they should have
      been symmetric). The solution was to grid-cell-sample
      along the normal vector to the surface. This helped
      alot and fixed the problem, however, before doing a
      fine-mesh sampling it can be nice to get a feel for it
      using very few points.
